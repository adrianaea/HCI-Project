          <li>
            ½ cup milk
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3> Directions: </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 13x9-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread 20 potato nuggets in the casserole dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef mixture with 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, steak seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper.

          <li>
            Smash the warmed potato nuggets in the casserole dish to cover the bottom completely. Spread ground beef mixture over the mashed potato nuggets. Pour soup mixture evenly over the beef layer. Top with remaining potato nuggets and sprinkle 1 cup Cheddar cheese evenly over the nuggets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until casserole is bubbly and potatoes golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.

      <br />
      <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
      <div class="container">
       <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs sirloin or ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1/3 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk or heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: balsamic glaze, blue cheese, fresh chopped parsley</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3> Directions: </h3>
      <ol>
       <li>Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper and place in a ziplock or reusable storage bag with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes, or overnight</li>
       <li>While the steak is marinating, cook the pasta according to the package directions. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil then add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water then drain the pasta from the rest of the water and set aside.</li>
       <li>Heat a large skillet, like a cast iron skillet, over medium high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, shaking off any excess. Sear the steak for 4 minutes on each side or until it reaches your desired doneness. I like to remove the steak when it reaches an internal temp of 135°F for medium-rare steak (target temp 145°F). Rest for 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>While the steak is resting, melt the butter in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the flour to the butter and stir well to create a paste (a roux). Cook the roux for 2-3 minutes to ensure the flour is fully cooked.</li>
       <li>Slowly whisk in the milk then add the salt and pepper. Continue to stir and simmer for about 5 minutes, until thickened. Add the parmesan cheese and stir until melted and combined.</li>
       <li>Toss the cooked pasta with the alfredo sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, pour in the reserved pasta water a few tablespoons at a time to reach your desired consistency.</li>
       <li>Slice the steak into thin pieces. Divide the pasta into bowl and top with steak slices.  Drizzle with balsamic glaze and garnish with gorgonzola cheese and fresh parsley if desired.</li>
