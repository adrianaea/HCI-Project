    <br />
        <img src = "/images/kaneki.jpg" alt = "Ken Kaneki In Dead By Daylight">
    <br />
        <p1>The popular Video Game Dead by Daylight has officially added their first of what we can presume to be many anime crossovers for their game, starting with the iconic Ken Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul! Fans are divided on the addition because of the mechanics of the character and the similarity to so many of the other "killers" that are already in the game, but we can hope this will increase demand for other characters to be included, such as, any of the Titan Shifters from Attack on Titan or some of the Ninjas from Naruto such as Orochimaru or Zabuza. The Tokyo Ghoul x DBD DLC pack is available on the steam store on April 2nd, 2025 for what we can assume will be priced at the same price as the other standard DLC packs, 4.99! Prepare for the arrival of Ghouls in the world of Dead by Daylight!</p1>

    <br />
        <img src = "/images/BROnePiece.jpg" alt = "Baskin Robin's One Piece Flavor">
    <br />
        <p1>Baskin Robin's franchises in Japan are getting a brand new flavor based on the Devil Fruit from One Piece. We can only assume what the actual flavor will be, probably some mix between Dragon Fruit and Ube to give it the classic purple color. We are looking forward to seeing reviews on it because unfortunately we can't be there for the release, but we are praying due to the rising popularity of One Piece that there might be a potential world wide release sometime in the future... Fingers Crossed!</p1>

    <br />
        <img src = "/images/fortnite.png" alt = "Fortnite x Anime Crossover">
    <br />
        <p1>In a shocking move (Not shocking at all) Fortnite is crossing over with Jujutsu Kaisen again to bring us skins based on more fan favorites from the series. In the last crossover, we got Yuji, Mahito and Gojo. In the revisit, we've been granted the incredible Sukuna, Toji, and Mahito lineup to scratch that itch players have of playing as the villians of their favorite series. It is available as a full pack for all characters listed at 3,800 V-Bucks or seperately in individual packs for 1,500 V-Bucks each. You can find them in the item shop until February 13th, 2025 at 8 PM before the item shop refreshes. Make sure to grab your favorite cursed sorcerers while you can! <p1>
