      <p><strong>Jujutsu Kaisen... 8.5 / 10 [SPOILERS!!!]</strong></p>
      <p1>Jujutsu Kaisen is relatively new in the world of anime, but it has quickly taken the world by storm. In what started as just another fantasy action anime, a mixture of calculated risks, incredible animation visuals and riveting storytelling has created what some would call a modern masterpiece. While this series is still ongoing, MAPPA shows no signs of slowing down with the upcoming season covering one of the more intruiging and influential arcs in the entire story. Season 1 was great at laying the groundwork for the story and helped build up characters to the audience while Season 2 concluded the stories for a lot of those characters and left the audience on the edge of their seat and heartbroken. The way that Gege Akutami built up these characters and made the audience fall in love with them only for those characters to meet a tragic end in the Shibuya Incident arc worked as a way to show that this was going to be anything but a prototypical feel good series. Losing fan favorite characters such as Jogo, Nanami, and Nobara proved to everyone that Gege wasn't messing around and was willing to kill off favorites to serve the story. Something that a lot of fans would consider sacreligious, Gege wasn't scared and didn't back down. This series is still on-going and I am very much looking forward to what's to come in Season 3 and beyond! </p1>

      <p><strong>Attack on Titan... 9 / 10 [SPOILERS!!!]</strong></p>
      <p1>Attack on Titan might be one of the greatest anime series ever created due to the fact that the story is riveting from beginning to end, has a clear path and works at delivering a fulfilling story with each arc. Yes, even Season 2 was fulfilling even though it was the shortest and most rushed season of the series. The story of Eren going from a naive child who wanted to learn the secrets of the world outside of the Walls, to finding out he had Titan shifting abilities, to eventually finding out how to harness his powers fully in an attempt to give his friends on Paradis island a safe and peaceful life is a great story that shows heartbreak and perserverance when things fall apart. Attack on Titan is one of those series' that gets better with each and every rewatch! You pick up on things that you may have missed with previous watches and the story makes more and more sense with each rewatch. I am currently on watch number 4 and even though I know whats coming, the story is so good and compelling that there's no wonder why people consider it one of the best anime of all time. Watching Eren Yeager go from an innocent child fueled by rage and vengeance to a borderline genocidal maniac all becuase he wanted to protect his friends in the war for humanity is one of the most dramatic character development stories I think we've ever seen. The story of Marley, the Eldians, the Rumbling, all of it makes sense in the big picture. As evil as Eren's actions are, you almost want him to win because you've spent this long on his side, rooting him on. The fact that Hajime Isayama was willing to go in that direction with such a beloved protagonist shows that the story was realistically a tragedy the entire time. We were given false hope that Eren would succeed and free the people of Paradis from the curse of the Titans only to have all of it yanked from us during the last season. In my opinion, Attack on Titan is one of the two greates anime ever released, and it's certainly not number 2...</p1>

      <img src = "/images/akamegakill.jpg" alt = "Akame Ga Kill! Splash Art" />
      <p><strong>Akame Ga Kill!... 8 / 10 [SPOILERS!!!]</strong></p>
      <p1>Akame Ga Kill! was one of the first anime I've ever watched that genuinely caught me off guard constantly. Gege Akutami used this anime as inspiration for Jujutsu Kaisen and its obvious why. The way that Akame Ga Kill! has influenced other works puts it up there among other heavy hitters in anime. They spend time building up characters like Tatsumi, Bulat and Sheele covering their backstories and history to make your connection with these characters deeper and more meaningful so that way when it's time for them to meet their fate, it hits you harder. Making lovable characters that you fall in love with leads to a much more emotional death. It's one of my favorite tropes in anime and it's honestly a newer trope. Instead of focusing on everyone making it to the end through the power of friendship, more and more anime are okay with killing off their main characters in tragic ways to make the audience feel the pain, sadness and betrayal of losing their favorites. That trope really started with Akame Ga Kill! due to the fact that it was one of the first mainstream anime that was willing to kill off their main characters to serve the story. Akame Ga Kill! does it in a way that leaves a "secondary" character all alone at the end when everyone around her dies. Seeing how this anime has influenced a plethora of other anime such as Attack on Titan and Jujutsu Kaisen proves to me that Akame Ga Kill! is up there with the greats!</p1>
