      <h2>The Power of Music in Video Games: <br /> How It Could Make or Break a Game</h2>
      
      <section>
        <p>In video games, it’s often the unforgettable moments that stay with us long after the screen fades to black. Whether it’s the heart-wrenching death of a beloved character, the adrenaline-fueled clash with a final boss, or a quirky, joyful minigame, these moments become iconic. But one element can elevate them from simply great to truly unforgettable: the music.</p>
        <p>When composed and timed correctly, music becomes more than just background noise. It amplifies the atmosphere, stirs emotion, and draws the player deeper into the world. Conversely, a poorly chosen track can completely derail the immersion, pulling you out of the experience like a record scratch at a funeral.</p>
        <p>Just imagine: your favorite party member is bleeding out in a pivotal scene, emotions are high, and then the upbeat menu music from <em>Bloons Tower Defense 6</em> starts to play. Not a bad tune, sure, but hilariously inappropriate in the moment.</p>
        <p>Let’s dive into examples of games where the music perfectly matches the tone and also explore titles that simply wouldn’t be the same without their soundtracks.</p>

        <h3>Games Where Music Matches the Tone Flawlessly</h3>
    
        <h4>Persona Series</h4>
        <p>Persona has various settings to match the theme with songs like “Beneath the Mask” for the evening. But also branches into more action-packed and hyped-up songs like “Life Will Change”.</p>
    
        <h4>Yakuza Series</h4>
        <p>Yakuza expertly transitions between emotional piano pieces during deep narrative moments and bombastic, rock-infused tracks during street fights. Songs like “Receive You” or “Pledge of Demon” not only match but define the intensity of the action.</p>
    
        <h4>Haste: Broken Worlds</h4>
        <p>A roguelite where the music is meant to match the speed of the gameplay. Constantly running and avoiding
          obstacles to reach the end, a fast-paced soundtrack is necessary.</p>
    
        <h4>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h4>
        <p>Sparse and subtle, the music in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> gives room for the world itself to breathe. The quiet piano flourishes that punctuate exploration feel in sync with nature, never overwhelming but always guiding your emotional compass.</p>
    
        <h4>Hollow Knight</h4>
        <p>The melancholic orchestral tones underscore the solitude and mystery of Hallownest. Tracks like “City of Tears” provide a backdrop that deepens the immersion in this silent, forgotten world.</p>

        <h3>Games That Wouldn’t Be the Same Without Their Soundtracks</h3>
    
        <h4>Undertale</h4>
        <p>Toby Fox’s iconic indie hit owes much of its impact to its music. Songs like “Megalovania” and “Hopes and Dreams” are now legendary with millions of streams to this day. The soundtrack enhances the scene and makes any moment unforgettable.</p>
    
        <h4>Celeste</h4>
        <p>The music in <em>Celeste</em> is tied to the pacing, mood, and even gameplay mechanics of the game. It adjusts dynamically based on where you are and how you’re doing, providing both emotional resonance and gameplay cues.</p>

        <p>A great soundtrack doesn’t just support a moment, it defines it.</p>
