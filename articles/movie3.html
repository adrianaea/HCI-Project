      <h2>🎬 What Is the Bechdel Test?</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to gender representation in film, the <strong>Bechdel Test</strong> has become a simple but powerful tool for sparking conversations. Named after cartoonist <strong>Alison Bechdel</strong>, this three-rule test originated from a 1985 comic and has since become a modern standard for examining female presence in media.

        <h3>✅ The Bechdel Test Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It must have at least <strong>two named women</strong>,</li>
          <li>Who <strong>talk to each other</strong>,</li>
          <li>About <strong>something other than a man</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sounds simple—but you’d be surprised how many popular movies fall short. Let's take a look.

        <h3>💡 Why the Bechdel Test Matters</h3>
        <p>
          The Bechdel Test isn’t the only way to measure good storytelling or feminism, but it does highlight how often women are underrepresented or sidelined in popular media. Even films with powerful female leads can lack real, nuanced interaction between women.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not about shaming filmmakers—it’s about encouraging broader perspectives and more inclusive storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>Media shapes how we see the world—and ourselves. When women are constantly shown as side characters or romantic interests, it narrows our perception of their role in society. On the other hand, rich, diverse representation has the power to inspire empathy, broaden understanding, and influence aspirations.</p>

        <h3>👀 What Can Viewers Do?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Support inclusive films</strong> at the box office and on streaming platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Talk about representation</strong> with friends and communities.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask critical questions</strong>—Who gets to speak? Who’s missing?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The more demand there is for real, inclusive storytelling, the more the industry will evolve to reflect it.</p>

        <h3>📣 Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Whether you’re a casual movie lover or a filmmaker, the Bechdel Test invites all of us to think critically about representation. It’s a reminder that women are more than love interests or plot devices—they’re people with stories worth telling.
