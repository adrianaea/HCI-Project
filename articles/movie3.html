    <h2>ðŸŽ¬ What Is the Bechdel Test?</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to gender representation in film, the <strong>Bechdel Test</strong> has become a simple but powerful tool for sparking conversations. Named after cartoonist <strong>Alison Bechdel</strong>, this three-rule test originated from a 1985 comic and has since become a modern standard for examining female presence in media.
    </p>

    <h3>âœ… The Bechdel Test Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It must have at least <strong>two named women</strong>,</li>
      <li>Who <strong>talk to each other</strong>,</li>
      <li>About <strong>something other than a man</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sounds simpleâ€”but youâ€™d be surprised how many popular movies fall short. Let's take a look.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸš« Popular Movies That Donâ€™t Pass the Bechdel Test</h3>
    <ul>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</span>: Iconic female characters, but they never interact with one another.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">The Avengers (2012)</span>: Black Widow and Maria Hill share the screen, but mostly talk about men or missions.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">The Social Network</span>: Focuses entirely on male characters. Women are present, but underdeveloped.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</span>: Great female leads, but they donâ€™t engage in personal conversations outside the central plot.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">Star Wars: A New Hope</span>: Leia is powerful, but doesn't share a scene with another named woman.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">The Grand Budapest Hotel</span>: Stylistic masterpiece, but lacking female interaction.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">The Wolf of Wall Street</span>: Overwhelmingly male-driven narrative, women are sidelined.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">La La Land</span>: Mia has female friends, but their conversations center around love and career with Sebastian.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">The Imitation Game</span>: Joan Clarke is a standout, but has no conversations with other women.</li>
      
      <li><span class="movie-title">Gravity</span>: Sandra Bullock dominates the filmâ€”but is completely alone for most of it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ðŸ’¡ Why the Bechdel Test Matters</h3>
    <p>
      The Bechdel Test isnâ€™t the only way to measure good storytelling or feminism, but it does highlight how often women are underrepresented or sidelined in popular media. Even films with powerful female leads can lack real, nuanced interaction between women.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not about shaming filmmakersâ€”itâ€™s about encouraging broader perspectives and more inclusive storytelling.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ“£ Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      Whether youâ€™re a casual movie lover or a filmmaker, the Bechdel Test invites all of us to think critically about representation. Itâ€™s a reminder that women are more than love interests or plot devicesâ€”theyâ€™re people with stories worth telling.
